# image-searcher-app
FCC image search abstraction layer project

This repo contains two versions. The requirements for FCC include an offset parameter that allows the user to control which result they begin receiving. I did not like this feature and replaced it with a feature to allow you to choose how many results to return. I have included both versions here to satisfy FCC requirements.
